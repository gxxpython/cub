- ## Parcine

	- [x] parce first element
	- [x] parce map

- ## Ray_cast
	- [x] draw a simple map
	- [x] make player move
	- [x] put one ray
	- [x] make ray rotate
	***
	- [ ] determine the direction `<` `^` `>` and `v`
	- [ ] determine the coordinates `there is thre steps`
		- [ ] `1` det coordinates that is represent a wall at the intersictions with __x__
		- [ ] `2` det coordinates that is represent a wall at the intersictions with __y__
			- in the two steps above we should write a function that that calculate the coord `(x,y)`
				and other one that check if you can  move to this coordinates
		- [ ] `3` choos the coordinates that have a ray __R__ less than other
	- [ ] make the ray stop if there are a wall in the next position
